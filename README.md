**HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**

- **Purpose:** HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage. It defines the elements that make up a page (headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.) and how they're organized.
- **How it works:** HTML uses "tags" to mark up the different elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). 
    - **Opening tag:** `<element>` (e.g., `<h1>`)
    - **Closing tag:** `</element>` (e.g., `</h1>`)
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture of a cat">
  ```
- **Common Tags:** `<h1>`-`<h6>` (headings), `<p>` (paragraphs), `<a>` (links), `<img>` (images), `<div>` (containers), `<ul>`, `<ol>` (lists), `<form>` (forms), and many more.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**

- **Purpose:** CSS gives webpages their visual style. It controls the appearance of HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing.
- **How it works:** CSS uses rules to apply styles to elements. A rule consists of a selector (what to style) and a declaration block (how to style it).
    - **Selector:**  `element` (e.g., `h1`), `class` (e.g., `.my-class`), `id` (e.g., `#my-id`)
    - **Declaration Block:**  `property: value;` (e.g., `color: blue;`)
- **Example:**
  ```css
  h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 36px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

**Tags in a Nutshell:**

- **What they are:** Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They tell the web browser how to interpret and display content. 
- **Different types:** HTML has a wide variety of tags for different purposes (text, images, multimedia, forms, etc.).
- **Structure:** Most tags come in pairs (opening and closing), although some are self-closing (e.g., `<img>`).

**Analogy:**

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage, providing the basic structure. CSS is like the clothes and makeup, dressing up the skeleton to make it look attractive. Tags are the individual bones (elements) that make up the skeleton.
